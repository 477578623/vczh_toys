# The previous draft is actually an object-oriented database, not a graph database, so I am going to redesign it.
#
# Concepts:
# 	Collection, Index, View (List, Tree, Partial Ordering, Graph), Collection Variable
# 	Struct, Class, Data Class, Computation Collection, Query, Function, Function Closure
# 	View Operation (Create Subtree, Subgraph Matching, Path Searching, etc)
# 	Pattern Matching, Multiple Dispatching
